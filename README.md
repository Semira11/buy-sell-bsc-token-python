Pancakeswap or Uniswap trading process can sometimes be slow, leading to delays and missed trading opportunities. This project seeks to address this issue by developing a Python program that can execute token transactions on Pancakeswap at an accelerated speed, up to 10 times faster than the original implementation.

Setup
Edit config.json file with your wallet address, private key, sellProfit, Amount to spend per buy.

Run "py tokenSniper.pyc" to start the program or run Launchbot.bat and Start Sniping! $$$$

Configuration File (config.json)

When you download the bot, you will find a config.json file. This is where you need to add the following data.


walletAddress: your public BSC wallet address

walletPrivateKey: the private key of your wallet address (Note: your private key is only stored securely locally)

amountToSpend: The amount of BNB you want to use for each token buy. (e.g. 0.01 means each successful snipe will buy 0.01 BNB or ETH worth of the token)

gasAmount: amount of max gas to use per transaction. Recommended to leave at default.

gasPrice: max price of gas to use per transaction. Recommended to leave at default.

Things to note

Please check that you have enough BNB or ETH in your wallet to afford sniping new tokens. If you don’t the bot will not work.

Please be careful when editing the config.json file. If you delete a comma or quotation mark etc. the bot will not work and throw an error.

You can use PowerShell or WSL2 and ensure you have Python3+ installed if you're a Windows user. If you're a Mac/Linux user, simply use the Terminal.

FAQs
I keep getting ‘Transaction failed’ – what’s going on? Either:

Gas amount / price too low
Wallet address / private key incorrect
Not enough BNB to pay for the token and TX fees
The bot isn’t sniping that fast (eg. couple seconds between detection and buying)
